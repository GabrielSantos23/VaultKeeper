### 🔧 Fixes & Polish

- **Settings UI Overhaul**:
  - Fixed cut-off text on 'Repair Connection' and 'Check for Updates' buttons by allowing dynamic sizing.
  - Resolved layout issues where labels for toggle switches (e.g., Auto-lock) were invisible or compressed.
  - Removed unused settings (Language, Notifications, Local Sync) for a cleaner experience.
- **Sidebar UX**:
  - Fixed the 'Reopen Sidebar' button in the item list, which was previously failing to appear after closing the sidebar.
- **Stability**:
  - Fixed a crash in the 'Repair Connection' tool on Linux caused by permission errors in the AppImage environment.
