VAULTKEEPER - Your Fortress for Passwords
=======================================

🔒 Secure. Offline. Yours.

VaultKeeper bridges your desktop vault directly to your browser, offering seamless autofill without ever exposing your data to the cloud. Experience the convenience of a modern password manager with the uncompromising security of local encryption.

✨ KEY FEATURES:

🚀 Instant Autofill
Stop typing passwords manually. VaultKeeper detects login fields and fills them instantly with a single click.

🛡️ Zero-Knowledge & 100% Local
Your data never leaves your device. Unlike cloud managers, VaultKeeper relies on a secure local connection to the desktop application. We don't track you, and we can't see your passwords.

💾 Smart Save
Created a new account? VaultKeeper automatically detects it and offers to secure it in your vault immediately.

⚡ Lightning Fast
Built with native messaging technology for zero latency. No loading spinners, no server connection delays.

📝 Secure Notes & Organization
Access more than just passwords. Organize your digital life with secure notes and custom categories right from the extension popup.

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
This extension requires the **VaultKeeper Desktop Application** to be installed and running on your computer. It acts as a secure bridge to your local vault.
